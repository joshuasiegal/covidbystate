      <h3>(More or Less) Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

      <dl>
        <dt>What do these charts show?</dt>
        
          <dd>I wanted a way to compare the different trajectories of state coronavirus cases, so I could get a quick comparative picture of how various states were dealing with the crisis.  Each line shows a timeline of a particular state, relative to its highest number of cases per day.  They overlay in the chart for easy comparison.</dd>

        <dt>What do these charts not show?</dt>
        
          <dd>These charts do not show absolute data, per capita data, logarithmic data, fatalities, or any other statistics besides daily case counts relative to highest daily case counts.  There are a lot of good resources for other numbers online, for example, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html" target="_blank">NYT Coronavirus Tracker</a> or the <a href="https://ncov2019.live/" target="_blank">ncovid2019.live</a> tracker.  And, of course, there's <a href="https://covidtracking.com/" target="_blank">The Covid Tracking Project</a>, which is the data source for this project.</dd>


        <dt>How does this site make money?</dt>

          <dd>It doesnâ€™t.  This site is provided as a free resource.  I had trouble finding a visualization of relative coronavirus cases by state, so I made this tool.  I hope it helps people get a picture of how various states are battling coronavirus.</dd>


        <dt>How can I help</dt>

          <dd><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/morgansimon/2020/04/14/covid-19-giving-guide-how-to-donate-to-reach-the-most-marginalized/#323d96d31a72" target="_blank">Here is an article that details some ways to help.</a><br /><br />Also, you can protect other people by <em>wearing your mask</em>.</dd>
